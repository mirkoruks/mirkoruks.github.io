Hi! Thanks you stopped by! This is the first post of my blog series about `twinflex`, a R function I wrote to make biometric twin modeling easier. While you can find a shorter description of the function [here](https://github.com/mirkoruks/twinflex), the purpose of the blog series is to dig deeper into the statistics behind the function in order to let you know what is actually going on "under the hood". Everything you can do with `twinflex`, you can do it with `OpenMx` as well, which is a very flexible package for Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in R. The reason for that is that `twinflex` is a simple wrapper for `OpenMx`. So why `twinflex` you may ask? 

The basic idea of SEM
======
The basic idea of every SEM model is very simple: You estimate the expected covariance matrix as a function of the model parameters. The inclusion of the means vector is optional, but the same idea applies: Estimate the expected means vector as a function of the model parameters. The ratio of the momentum to the velocity is
the relativistic mass, m.

And the relativistic mass and the relativistic
kinetic energy are related by the formula:

![f2]

Einstein wanted to omit the unnatural second term
on the right-hand side, whose only purpose is
to make the energy at rest zero, and to declare
that the particle has a total energy, which obeys:
![f3] which is a sum of the rest energy ![f4]
and the kinetic energy.

Aren't headings cool?
